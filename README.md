## Team vibe / organisation

- Check in (how are you? How do you feel about working on this larger project?)
  Good!

- Wellbeing for each person (when I’m stressed ... I need...) (general needs eg. kids, illness, sleep etc) for each person:
  Stress profiles and what helps us move forward:

  **Mel:** I go very quiet because internally I'm panicing. I also may appear to be a bit abrupt, but that's only because I don't what to say - it's nothing persoanl. To counteract this, I need sleep, breaks and coffee.
  
  **Ashley:** Face changes and looks grumpy. I need to chat to people, go for a walk and sleep or drink coffee to counteract this. 
  
  **Eben:** I go quiet. I stop joking. To manage this, I need sleep / coffee and try to maintain a sense of humour. 
  
  **Mimi:** I stop laughing when I'm stressed. I need music / to be alone and go for a walk.
  
  **Serafin:** I go quiet - even more than I already am. I need space.

- Expectation setting and agreements (what do we each want out of this time, what hours will we keep outside of bootcamp, what do we do when conflict arises, how will we communicate, especially what hours work will happen over the weekend)

  We may work in the evenings (we'll see how we go). We will use Slack to communicate with each other around this. However, we've decided that we will come into Campus on Saturday from 10 until 4.30/5pm. We will get in touch with the Human Skills facilitators if there is conflict in terms of team morale. If there is a conflict regarding the tech side, we will get in touch with a facilitator - this will be done within a reasonable timeframe so we keep the momentum and productivity going.

- How will you make decisions together? How will you handle conflict?

  When it comes to decisions, we will come together in a stand up and we will make decisions as a team. When it comes to conflict, see above, however, we will apply what we have learnt in the Human Skills sessions, i.e. non-violent communication / couragous conversations model.

- How will you, individually and as a team, get the help you need both technically and non-technically?

  See above!

- How will you make sure everyone feels included?
  
  Everyone havin the responsibility of being vibe checker and having their ideas heard.

- How will you decide who needs to be present for which conversations
  
  Depends on the role of the person and the feature that's being worked on.

- How will you work (what roles and what agile rituals will you use etc)

  **Eben:** Scrum Lead
  
  **Ashley:** PO
  
  **Serfain:** Backend Lead
  
  **Mimi:** Frontend Lead
  
  **Mel** Git Keeper

- How will you survive (Will you eat together? How will you break the tension? What is your fun times plan?)
  
  We will eat together and play games

## Project planning

- What is your MVP? How much work do you think it will take to achieve it? When do you want to reach MVP by?
  WIP (need to do user stories and wireframing)
  
- What tech will you be using? Is there anything you need to research? If you’re using our stack, will you use Redux?
  We will be using react-redux - we are yet to decide on a CSS framework, this may be tailwind.
  
- GitFlow. How will you arrange your work?
  We will have individual branches, either solo or in pairs. We're still deciding on how best to split up the tasks (Sprints).
  
- Roles. Which will you use? Who will be accountable for which areas? Will you swap roles at some point?
  See above for roles. We are hoping to retain these for the entire week as we feel it may become too disruptive and confusing if we decide to swap, but we will revisit if needed.
  
- What might a day look like? What agile rituals will happen? When during the day will you do the hard tech? Will you go outside _as a team_?
  We will be incorporating standups, kanban, sprints and retros. We want to use the majority of the day to do tech, but will have some down time as team.
  
- How will you reflect and improve over the week?
  We will do a retro at the end of each day.
